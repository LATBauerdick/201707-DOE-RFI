    This note provides a response to the request for information from DOE to the U.S. CMS Operations Program to give an estimate of the yearly computing resource needs in CPU, disk and tape up to 2027, with a possible extension to 2030; and to discuss which of these needs can be fulfilled by HPC centers and/or commercial clouds.
    \par
    The document gives an introduction to the CMS workflow types, followed by a brief status report of our capabilities to use Intelâ€™s Knights Landing (KNL) CPU architecture and progress in using HPC centers and commercial clouds. We introduce the input parameters to the model used to estimate resource needs for Run 3 and the HL-LHC era, followed by a discussion of the resulting overall CMS yearly resource needs.  We conclude by discussing the year-by-year computing resources to be provisioned by U.S. CMS, and the possible utilization of HPC and commercial cloud resources.
