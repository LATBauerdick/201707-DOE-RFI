# Response to Request for Information on U.S. CMS Software and Computing Resource Planning

Introduction
--------------------

This response to the request for information from DOE to the U.S. CMS
Operations Program provides an estimate of the yearly computing resource
needs in CPU, disk and tape from 2017 to 2027, with a possible extension
to 2030; and discusses which of these needs can be fulfilled by HPC
centers and/or commercial clouds.


This document gives an introduction to the CMS workflow types, followed
by a brief status report of our capabilities to use Intelâ€™s Knights
Landing (KNL) CPU architecture and progress in using HPC centers and
commercial clouds. We then introduce the input parameters to the model,
followed by a discussion of the overall CMS yearly resource needs. We
conclude by discussing the year-by-year computing resources to be
provisioned by U.S. CMS, and the possible utilization of HPC and
commercial cloud resources.
