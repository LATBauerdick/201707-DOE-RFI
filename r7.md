Conclusions
-------------------

This note presents an initial estimate of overall CMS computing resource needs through 2030, and the expected U.S. CMS share.  We emphasize that these estimates have not been vetted by CMS management and have significant uncertainties, especially for the HL-LHC era, which is sufficiently far off that there could be disruptive technology changes.  While the needs appear to be manageable for Run 2 and Run 3, given the general stability of LHC conditions and our experience with them, Run 4 is expected to be much more challenging, and transformative changes will be required to provide sufficient data analysis resources to fully exploit the physics potential of the HL-LHC era.  We described a number of possible changes, including the development of new data formats and specialized computing facilities for analysis.  Our estimates of resource needs also include the fraction of the processing that could be completed at HPC centers or commercial clouds.  U.S. CMS has demonstrated the use of these facilities for the main CMS workflows, but has also identified a number of issues that need to be solved through R&D efforts to use HPC centers and commercial clouds efficiently.
